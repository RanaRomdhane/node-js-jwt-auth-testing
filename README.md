# 🔐 Node.js JWT Auth - Complete Testing Suite

A comprehensive testing implementation for a Node.js JWT Authentication API with MongoDB. Features complete test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, performance benchmarks, and security testing.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+
- MongoDB 4+

### Installation & Testing

#### 1. Clone and setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RanaRomdhane/node-js-jwt-auth-testing.git
cd node-js-jwt-auth-testing
npm install
```

#### 2. Run all tests
```bash
npm test
```

#### 3. Run specific test types
```bash
# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests  
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# With coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```
